# CTGrazer #
**CTGrazer** is code you can use to create an *AWS Lambda* Function that will collect all of your *AWS CloudTrail* logs and efficiently send them to your *Splunk HEC (HTTP Event Collector)* server.

#### Why?
Using **CTGrazer** to port your AWS CloudTrail logs into Splunk has many advantages
* **Speed** *CloudTrail* logs are processed as soon as they become available
* **Security** All data is **encrypted** in transit and it does not rely on AWS IAM Access Keys
* **Scalable** CTGrazer will automatically **scale up** and down according to your needs
* **Reliable** If CTGrazer can't get your logs to their destination, it will **automatically retry** until it can
* **Cost Effectiveness** Pulling in **400K objects** a month will cost you about the same as a **cheeseburger!**

#### Pre-requisites
| **AWS**       | **Splunk**     | **Python**     |
| :------------ | :------------- | :------------- |
| **[Execution Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3.html):** <br/> Put Trigger for *S3 Bucket* | **[HTTP Event Collector (HEC)](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.1.1/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector) :** <br/> *Authentication Token* | [Requests Module](https://pypi.org/project/requests/2.18.1/) |

#### Splunk Cloud | HEC VPC Configurations
<p>If you are a <b>Splunk Cloud Customer</b> and plan to use splunk indexers as HEC endpoint, you should NOT set any VPC settings for Lambda to be able to stream data to your indexers. Only setting required here is to open inbound SG's on Splunk Cloud to allow this traffic. If no VPC Settings are enabled, Lambda uses it's own endpoint which has internet access by default to connect to resources outside of your own VPC.
</p>

#### Splunk Internal | HEC VPC Configurations
<p>For Internal HEC endpoints, VPC , subnets and SG rules need to be applied.
